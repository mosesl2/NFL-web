<h2>Leading  offensive players this NFL Season</h2>
<p>In this Season, many players have excelled to incredible heights, but some definitely stood out of the pack. These offensive players took their position and team to success (mostly). This was an odd year, with many under the radar players doing incredible, and all-stars being underwhelming and riddled with injuries.

  <h4>Leading Players (Statistically)</h4>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;"><h3>Rushing Yards:</h3>
<h4>Christian McCaffrey (49ers)</h4>
<p>No surprise to most, as McCaffrey has been incredible for a long time now, being a key part is the 49ers success this season. <u>300 yards</u> clear of the player in 2nd, McCaffrey has been dominant this season. unstoppable when he's running, which has been quite a lot this season. McCaffrey claims his spot as the best RB in the league, and seems to be there to stay. <img src="Images/cmc.jpg"height="80%" width="80%"></p>


</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;"><h3>Passing Yards:</h3>
<h4>Tua Tagovailoa (Dolphins)</h4>
<p>Tua and Miami have had a great season, being real AFC threats. Tua has a ton of options for passing, including Tyreek Hill, who has been incredible this season. But <em>none</em> of that should truly discredit him. We saw last year how the Dolphins without Tua are not as good as when they have him. Tua, even with his weapons, has been incredible, consistently landing accurate passes, having the highest completion percentage of <strong>any </strong> starting QB in the league. Tua's game often gets discredited, but his season has been extraordinary. <img src="Images/tua.jpg"height="75%" width="75%"></p>
</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;"><h3>Recieving Yards:</h3>
<h4>Tyreek Hill (Dolphins)</h4>
<p> Tyreek has been <strong>unstoppable</strong> this season, tearing through defense after defense without stopping. his incredible speed has been the major highlight of his game, as nobody can seem to stop him. even with <u>Waddle</u>, another incredible wide reciever, Tyreek stays dominant with his yards. with less receptions than others in the top 5 for yards, he still manages to have far more yards. A player everyone knew would shine, but not many thought to this degree. <img src="Images/Tyreek.webp" height="80%" width="80%"></p>

<div class="footer" style="background-color: #ddd ;">
  <h3>Breakouts</h3>
  <h4>Puka Nacua (Rams)</h4>
  <p>Don't even pretend like anyone saw this coming. Nacua burst onto the scene out of nowhere, having weeks and weeks of superstar numbers. On a Rams team missing Kupp for the first weeks of the season, Nacua stepped up to the role they were missing and instantly made his way through every defense. Having such a major impact on his team in his rookie year like this, <em>especially</em> when he wasn't even a rookie everyone had their eyes on, is absolutely incredible. <img src="Images/Nacua.jpg" height="30%" width="30%"></p>
